The function name must be same as its name in above function list, and the arguments must obey the format required by the function. Enclose the function call within the tag \"<call></call>\".

The function name must be same as its name in above function list, and the arguments must obey the format required by the function. Enclose the function call within the tag \"<call></call>\". If possible, you can call multiple functions in parallel, be sure the functions called parallelly are independent of each other.\n**Final Answer**: When you believe the task is complete, you may use 'final_answer' to provide a detailed summary of the results to give to the user, enclose the final answer within the tag \"<final></final>\".\n\n"

Additionally, I want to take into account the average maintenance costs over these five years. Could you help me analyze this? I think we'd need data on fuel efficiency, average annual mileage, fuel costs, and maintenance costs for both cars. Thanks!"
